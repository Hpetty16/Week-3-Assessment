		<p>
			If I could describe my lovely neighborhood which is located in Royal Oak, MI ! I
			currently live in the Ecoute Sile Pleut Street. Near my street we can go to the
			supermarket, bakery, bookshops and also Chinese or Italian restaurants. Policemen and firefighters are very available if something wrong
			happens in our neighborhood. Behind my neighborhood we have a big lake and a
			recreation park where lots of people have fun in the summer. My neighbors are
			very kind, friendly and useful. One day my neighbors organized a party so I think
			we could call my neighborhood a community.
